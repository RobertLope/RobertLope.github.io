Project analysis:

-target user profile

In this project we have no analays the target. If we think about curriculum vitae, we think in work, in employees.
The target is a worker, department of Human Resources. But with experience in game dessing it can also be a single person that is growing a study.

-information architecture
The structure is gonna be firts of all the name and a image of the user(me in this case), a little information about the subject and links in social medias.
Next we can detail more info in next sections, Studies, Jobs and a work section.

-visual design
To the visual dessing I choose a simple one, with not of animations, with a pelet of colors that can mix togheter, and in columns the information.
Images in a good resolution and a navbar to navigate faster in the zone that user wants to see.
